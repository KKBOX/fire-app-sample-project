[Compass.app][compassapp] is a [Sass][sass]/[Compass][compass] app. It helps designers compile style[sheets easily without resorting to command line interface. It is a cross-platform software written in Java, and works in OS X/Windows/Linux.

[Compass.app][compassapp] 2.0 supports ERB/Haml templates. You can write layouts, partials, and helpers. (Just like a Rails/Sinatra application!)
